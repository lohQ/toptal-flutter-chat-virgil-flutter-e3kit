# Toptal Flutter Chat with Virgil E3Kit Flutter

This app is built on top of Toptal Flutter Chat App (https://github.com/nstosic/toptal-flutter-chat) and Virgil Flutter E3Kit Extended (https://github.com/lohQ/virgil-flutter-e3kit-extended). 

# Note

 - BLoC architecture. 
 - Facebook sign in and Google sign in. 
 - E3kit default encryption. (https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/e3kit/end-to-end-encryption/default/)
 - Support 1-to-1 messaging 
 - Support double ratchet algorithm (Android only). 
 - Currently does not support group messaging. 

# Future Improvements

 - Persist chat history. 
 - Handle Google/Facebook Sign In exceptions. 
 - Enable group messaging. 

# API keys

Note - if you clone this repository and try running the project, it'll fail because I've removed API keys for Facebook and Firebase. Refer to the [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) official documentation for a step-by-step guide to setting up the project.
